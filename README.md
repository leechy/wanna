## Built in public

This project is built in public. You can follow the progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/leechy/wanna). The app is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/), a platform for universal React applications. The app is written in TypeScript and uses [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for navigation. Backend is powered by [Supabase](https://supabase.io/), an open-source Firebase alternative.

You can find the public keys to use the database in the .env file. But if you want to use the code, you should create your own Supabase project and replace the keys.
